Hello, everyone!

My name is Daniel Sullivan. I am a student at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS)
and I am currently going for a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. My hobbies are
surfing the Internet, playing video games, collecting various things (cards, figures, coins, etc.),
watching TV, enjoying nature, golfing, and hanging out with my family. I have three dogs, all being
female, and their names are Toshi, Kaiya and Emi. I also have an older brother named Patrick, who
graduated from the Air Force Academy.
